<br>
<p>The first iconv library design issue arises when considering the
following two design approaches:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Have modules which implement conversion from the encoding A to the encoding B
and vice versa i.e., one conversion module relates to any two encodings.
</li><li> Have modules which implement conversion from the encoding A to the fixed
encoding C and vice versa i.e., one conversion module relates to any
one encoding A and one fixed encoding C. In this case, to convert from
the encoding A to the encoding B, two modules are needed (in order to convert
from A to C and then from C to B).
</li></ol>

<br>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious, that we have tradeoff between commonality/flexibility and
efficiency: the first method is more efficient since it converts
directly; however, it isn&rsquo;t so flexible since for each
encoding pair a distinct module is needed.
</p>
<br>
<p>The Newlib iconv model uses the second method and always converts through the 32-bit
UCS but its design also allows one to write specialized conversion
modules if the conversion speed is critical.
</p>
<br>
<p>The second design issue is how to break down (decompose) encodings.
The Newlib iconv library uses the fact that any encoding may be
considered as one or more CCS plus a CES. It also decomposes its
conversion modules on <em>CES converter</em> plus one or more <em>CCS
tables</em>. CCS tables map CCS to UCS and vice versa; the CES converters
map CCS to the encoding and vice versa.
</p>
<br>
<p>As the example, let&rsquo;s consider the conversion from the big5 encoding to
the EUC-TW encoding. The big5 encoding may be decomposed to the ASCII and BIG5
CCS-es plus the BIG5 CES. EUC-TW may be decomposed on the CNS11643_PLANE1, CNS11643_PLANE2,
and CNS11643_PLANE14 CCS-es plus the EUC CES.
</p>
<br>
<p>The euc_jp -&gt; big5 conversion is performed as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The EUC converter performs the EUC-TW encoding to the corresponding CCS-es
transformation (CNS11643_PLANE1, CNS11643_PLANE2 and CNS11643_PLANE14
CCS-es);
</li><li> The obtained CCS codes are transformed to the UCS codes using the CNS11643_PLANE1,
CNS11643_PLANE2 and CNS11643_PLANE14 CCS tables;
</li><li> The resulting UCS codes are transformed to the ASCII and BIG5 codes using
the corresponding CCS tables;
</li><li> The obtained CCS codes are transformed to the big5 encoding using the corresponding
CES converter.
</li></ol>

<br>
<p>Analogously, the backward conversion is performed as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> The BIG5 converter performs the big5 encoding to the corresponding CCS-es transformation
(the ASCII and BIG5 CCS-es);
</li><li> The obtained CCS codes are transformed to the UCS codes using the ASCII and BIG5 CCS tables;
</li><li> The resulting UCS codes are transformed to the ASCII and BIG5 codes using
the corresponding CCS tables;
</li><li> The obtained CCS codes are transformed to the EUC-TW encoding using the corresponding
CES converter.
</li></ol>

<br>
<p>Note, the above is just an example and real names (which are implemented
in the Newlib iconv) of the CES converters and the CCS tables are slightly different.
</p>
<br>
<p>The third design issue also relates to flexibility. Obviously, it isn&rsquo;t
desirable to always link all the CES converters and the CCS tables to the library
but instead, we want to be able to load the needed converters and tables
dynamically on demand. This isn&rsquo;t a problem on &quot;big&quot; machines such as
a PC, but it may be very problematical within &quot;small&quot; embedded systems.
</p>
<br>
<p>Since the CCS tables are just data, it is possible to load them
dynamically from external files.  The CES converters, on the other hand
are algorithms with some code so a dynamic library loading 
capability is required.
</p>
<br>
<p>Apart from possible restrictions applied by embedded systems (small
RAM for example), Newlib itself has no dynamic library support and
therefore, all the CES converters which will ever be used must be linked into
the library.   However, loading of the dynamic CCS tables is possible and is
implemented in the Newlib iconv library.  It may be enabled via the Newlib
configure script options.
</p>
<br>
<p>The next design issue is fine-tuning the iconv library
configuration.  One important ability is for iconv to not link all it&rsquo;s
converters and tables (if dynamic loading is not enabled) but instead,
enable only those encodings which are specified at configuration
time (see the section about the configure script options).
</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, the Newlib iconv library configure options distinguish between
conversion directions. This means that not only are supported encodings
selectable, the conversion direction is as well. For example, if user wants
the configuration which allows conversions from UTF-8 to UTF-16 and
doesn&rsquo;t plan using the &quot;UTF-16 to UTF-8&quot; conversions, he or she can 
enable only
this conversion direction (i.e., no &quot;UTF-16 -&gt; UTF-8&quot;-related code will
be included) thus, saving some memory (note, that such technique allows to
exclude one half of a CCS table from linking which may be big enough).
</p>
<br>
<p>One more design aspect are the speed- and size- optimized tables. Users can
select between them using configure script options. The
speed-optimized CCS tables are the same as the size-optimized ones in
case of 8-bit CCS (e.g.m KOI8-R), but for 16-bit CCS-es the size-optimized
CCS tables may be 1.5 to 2 times less then the speed-optimized ones. On the
other hand, conversion with speed tables is several times faster.
</p>
<br>
<p>Its worth to stress that the new encoding support can&rsquo;t be
dynamically added into an already compiled Newlib library, even if it
needs only an additional CCS table and iconv is configured to use
the external files with CCS tables (this isn&rsquo;t the fundamental restriction
and the possibility to add new Table-based encoding support dynamically, by
means of just adding new .cct file, may be easily added).
</p>
<br>
<p>Theoretically, the compiled-in CCS tables should be more appropriate for
embedded systems than dynamically loaded CCS tables.  This is because the compiled-in tables are read-only and can be placed in ROM
whereas dynamic loading requires RAM.  Moreover, in the current iconv
implementation, a distinct copy of the dynamic CCS file is loaded for each opened iconv descriptor even in case of the same encoding.
This means, for example, that if two iconv descriptors for
&quot;KOI8-R -&gt; UCS-4BE&quot; and &quot;KOI8-R -&gt; UTF-16BE&quot; are opened, two copies of
koi8-r .cct file will be loaded (actually, iconv loads only the needed part
of these files).  On the other hand, in the case of compiled-in CCS tables, there will always be only one copy.
